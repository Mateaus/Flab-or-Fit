Android Application

Udemy Course [Android N: From Beginner to Paid Professional] (https://www.udemy.com/learn-android/learn/v4/overview)

What I learned from this part of the course:
- Introduction to how to create an activity and move from Main Activity to another activity.
- Learned how to have 1 activity as a layout for multiple purposes. Ex. Details activity can change appareance and the information in it just by using 1 activity instead of creating multiple activities for each change(Weight Lifting, Yoga, Cardio).

What I learned myself:
- Learned to handle the percentage for WeightLifting by pressing the checkmarks inside the next activity.
- Learned how one activity can communicate with another activity to control the passing of values.
- Learned to customize the toolbar and create another activity that handles whether if the user wants the background light or dark.

Implementations based on what I learned from the course and myself:
- Cutomize toolbar with setting option.
- A button to change the background from light to dark or vice versa.
- Return buttons while holding the information from previous activity.
- Checkboxes are responsive and work as intended to calculate the percetage completed.

Purpose:
- To practice and learn the basics of android development for future projects.
